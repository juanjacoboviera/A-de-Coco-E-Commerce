Frontend Project Documentation for Coconut-Based E-Commerce Site

Overview:
This document provides an overview of the frontend design and development for an e-commerce site that specializes in selling coconut-based products.

Design:
The design of the website is clean and modern, with a focus on showcasing the products and making it easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for. The color scheme is primarily white, green and brown, with images of coconuts used throughout the site to create a cohesive and on-brand look. The layout is not fully responsive yet, however it will be in the near future.

Features:
The website features a home page, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout system, as well. There is also a search function, filtering options and a contact form that will be made available in upcoming commits.
Technologies:
The website is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is powered by the modern JavaScript framework React. There was no use of frameworks such as Tailwind or Bootstrap or CSS preprocessor such as Sass or Less. The website communicates with a backend with FireBase API to handle the processing of orders and handling of customer data.

Development:
The development process follows agile methodology and was divided into several sprints.

Deployment:
The website will be deployed on a cloud hosting platform such as AWS, Google Cloud or Heroku, and will be optimized for high performance and scalability. The website will be tested on multiple browsers and devices to ensure that it works properly and is accessible to all users.

Maintenance and Support:
The website will be maintained and supported by the development team to ensure that it remains functional and up-to-date. Any bugs or issues will be addressed in a timely manner, and new features may be added based on customer feedback and business needs.
